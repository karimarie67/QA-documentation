### **1. Add Coverage Reporting**
To track code coverage, you can add `pytest-cov` to your workflow. After running the tests, the report can be uploaded to Codecov.

#### Update to `actions.yml`:
```yaml
      - name: Generate Code Coverage
        run: |
          pip install pytest-cov
          pytest --cov=your_project

      - name: Upload Coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```

---

### **2. Add Integration Tests**
Integration tests check interactions between components like PostgreSQL, Redis, and your application. Place these tests in a separate folder (e.g., `integration_tests`).

#### Update to `actions.yml`:
```yaml
      - name: Run Integration Tests
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:${{ job.services.postgres.ports[5432] }}/postgres"
          REDIS_HOST: "localhost"
          CI: "true"
        run: |
          pytest integration_tests/
```

---

### **3. Add End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
Use tools like Playwright for E2E testing to simulate user interactions with your website.

#### Steps:
1. Install Playwright and its dependencies.
2. Write E2E tests in a folder (e.g., `e2e_tests`).

#### Update to `actions.yml`:
```yaml
      - name: Run End-to-End Tests
        run: |
          pip install playwright pytest-playwright
          playwright install
          pytest e2e_tests/
```

---

### **4. Add Security Scans**
Use `bandit` to automate security checks for Python code.

#### Update to `actions.yml`:
```yaml
      - name: Security Scan with Bandit
        run: |
          pip install bandit
          bandit -r your_project
```

---

### **5. Add Static Code Analysis**
Static analysis ensures code quality. Use tools like `flake8` or `pylint`.

#### Update to `actions.yml`:
```yaml
      - name: Static Code Analysis
        run: |
          pip install flake8
          flake8 your_project
```

---

### **6. Parallelize Jobs**
To speed up the CI process, split `test`, `build`, and linting into separate jobs. Hereâ€™s a sample structure:

#### Updated Workflow Structure:
```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Lint Python Code
        run: |
          pre-commit run --all-files
      - name: Static Code Analysis
        run: |
          pip install flake8
          flake8 your_project

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:12
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
          POSTGRES_DB: postgres
        ports: ["5432:5432"]

      redis:
        image: redis
        ports:
          - 6379:6379

    steps:
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: |
          pytest --cov=your_project

      - name: Run Integration Tests
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:${{ job.services.postgres.ports[5432] }}/postgres"
          REDIS_HOST: "localhost"
        run: |
          pytest integration_tests/

      - name: Generate Code Coverage
        run: |
          pip install pytest-cov
          pytest --cov=your_project

      - name: Upload Coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}

  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run End-to-End Tests
        run: |
          pip install playwright pytest-playwright
          playwright install
          pytest e2e_tests/
```

---

### **7. Accessibility Testing**
For websites, include accessibility testing with `pa11y`.

#### Update to `actions.yml`:
```yaml
      - name: Accessibility Testing
        run: |
          npm install -g pa11y
          pa11y http://localhost:8000
```

---

### **Next Steps**
1. **Test Locally**: Before committing these changes, test the new tools and configurations locally to ensure compatibility.
2. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary dependencies (e.g., `pytest-cov`, `playwright`, `bandit`) are included in your `requirements.txt` or installed during the workflow.
3. **Secrets Management**: Add any required secrets (e.g., `CODECOV_TOKEN`) in the repository's GitHub settings.
