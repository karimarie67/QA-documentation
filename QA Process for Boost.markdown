## 2. Testing Objectives

- Verify core website functionality in local and staging environments.
- Catch defects early in development to reduce issues in staging.
- Automate critical tests to ensure consistency and speed in CI/CD.
- Minimize manual testing.

## 3. Testing Types and Environments

### 3.1 Functional Testing (Local Dev Environment)

**Purpose**: Validate individual features in the local development environment before code is merged. Test individual tickets when ready.

**Approach**:
- Manual exploratory testing for new features and complex UI interactions.
- Ticket testing to ensure issues are fixed before merging to staging.
- Automated unit and integration tests for repetitive tasks.

**Environment**:
- Local setup using Docker to replicate the website stack.

**Tools**:
- Docker

**Examples**:
- Open boost.io in your local environment (`http://localhost:8000/`).
- Verify library pages and contents.

**Process**:
1. QA tests features as developers complete them.
2. Run automated unit tests before committing code.

### 3.2 End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Staging Environment)

**Purpose**: Simulate real user scenarios across the entire website (front-end to back-end) in a production-like staging environment.

**Approach**:
- Automate critical user journeys.
- Manual testing for edge cases or visual validation.

**Environment**:
- Staging environment mirroring production setup.
- Configured with production-like data and integrations.

**Tools**:
- BrowserStack (cross-browser testing).

**Examples**:
- Test complete user flow: landing page → content access → documentation → downloads.
- Validate responsive design on mobile devices in staging.

**Process**:
1. Run E2E tests after code is deployed to staging.
2. Perform manual checks for usability and visual issues.

### 3.3 Automated Testing (CI/CD Integration)

**Purpose**: Ensure code quality and prevent regressions by running automated tests during CI/CD.

**Approach**:
- Run unit and integration tests in CI for every commit.

- Smoke tests to verify core functionality post-deployment.

**Process**:
1. Deploy code to staging via GitHub Actions.
2. Run E2E tests to validate user flows.
3. Store test results for review.

**Outcome**: Confirms release candidate readiness for production.

**Tools**:
- GitHub Actions
- Cypress (TBD)
- Playwright (TBD)

## 5. Current Testing Points in CI/CD Workflows with Potential QA Integration Points

### Workflow: `actions-gcp.yaml`

**Existing Testing**:
- **Unit Tests**: Runs `pytest` in the `test` job.
- **Linting**: Uses `pre-commit` to lint code.

**Potential Testing Insertion Points**:
- **Before building Docker images in the `build` job**: Add integration tests for verifying components in a Dockerized environment.
- **After deployment to staging**: Add E2E testing to verify the application works correctly in the production-like environment.

### Workflow: `actions.yml`

**Existing Testing**:
- **Unit Tests**: Runs `pytest` in the `test` job.
- **Linting**: Uses `pre-commit` for code linting.

**Potential Testing Insertion Points**:
- **Before tagging and pushing Docker images**: Include security tests for Docker images, such as scanning for vulnerabilities.
- **After pushing Docker images**: Add smoke tests to ensure the images function correctly in the target environment.

### Workflow: `dependency_report.yml`

**Existing Testing**: None, as the focus is on generating a dependency report.

  - Verify that the site loads successfully without errors.
  - Check that the homepage displays key elements: logo, navigation bar, and main content.
- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Confirm that the primary navigation menu (e.g., Libraries, Documentation, Downloads, Community) is visible and clickable.
  - Verify that clicking each menu item directs to the correct page without 404 errors.
- **Library Listing**:
  - Ensure the libraries page loads and displays a list of Boost libraries (e.g., Boost.Asio, Boost.Beast).
  - Check that at least one library link is clickable and leads to its documentation page.
- **Download Functionality**:
  - Verify that the download section is accessible and displays available Boost versions.
  - Confirm that clicking a download link initiates a file download or redirects to a valid source (e.g., GitHub).
- **Search Functionality**:
  - Check that the search bar is present and accepts input.
  - Perform a basic search (e.g., “Boost.Asio”) and verify that results are displayed.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Access the homepage on a mobile device and confirm that the layout adjusts correctly (no overlapping elements).

**Expected Outcome**: All major features (homepage, navigation, library access, downloads, search) are operational, and the site is stable for further testing.

### 6.2 Sanity Testing

**Purpose**: Validate specific functionalities or modules after minor changes or bug fixes to ensure they work as expected. Sanity tests are narrower than smoke tests, focusing on critical areas affected by updates.

**Test Cases** (assuming recent updates, e.g., logo optimization or content migration from boost.org):
- **Logo Display**:
  - Verify that the logo image loads correctly and is optimized (e.g., size < 500 KB, dimensions appropriate, no pixelation).
  - Check that the logo does not resemble unintended symbols (e.g., addressing feedback about “SS” or “Gatorade” resemblance).
- **Content Equivalence**:
  - Confirm that key library documentation (e.g., Boost.Beast) on boost.io matches the content on boost.org for accuracy and completeness.
  - Verify that no critical information is missing.
- **Navigation Post-Update**:
  - Ensure that updated navigation links redirect to the correct pages without errors.
- **Search Post-Update**:
  - Test the search functionality for a specific library (e.g., “Boost.IO”) and verify that results are relevant and load correctly.
- **Download Link Integrity**:
  - Check that download links for the latest Boost release point to the correct files and are not broken after recent changes.
- **Accessibility Check**:
  - Verify that updated sections (e.g., homepage or documentation) meet basic accessibility standards (e.g., alt text for images, keyboard navigation).

**Expected Outcome**: Recently updated features (logo, content, navigation) function correctly, and no major issues are introduced in critical areas.

### 6.3 Functional Testing

**Purpose**: Validate that each feature of the website works according to requirements, covering all user interactions and edge cases.

**Test Cases**:
- **Homepage Functionality**:
  - Verify that all elements (header, footer, call-to-action buttons) are clickable and functional.
  - Check that external links (e.g., to GitHub or community forums) open in new tabs and are valid.
- **Library Documentation**:
  - Select a library (e.g., Boost.Beast) and verify that its documentation page includes sections like overview, examples, and API reference.
  - Test code example rendering: ensure code snippets are properly formatted and copyable.
  - Check that internal links within documentation (e.g., to related libraries) work correctly.
- **Search Functionality**:
  - Test search with valid inputs (e.g., “WebSocket”, “C++11”) and verify that results are accurate and ranked by relevance.
  - Test edge cases: empty search, special characters (e.g., “@#$”), and long queries (e.g., 100 characters).
  - Verify that search results load within 3 seconds and handle no-results cases gracefully.
- **Download Section**:
  - Test downloading different Boost versions (e.g., latest and previous releases) and verify file integrity (e.g., correct file size, no corruption).
  - Check that download instructions are clear and include prerequisites (e.g., OpenSSL for Boost.Beast).
- **Community Page**:
  - Verify that the community page loads and displays links to forums, mailing lists, or GitHub issues (e.g., https://github.com/boostorg/website-v2/issues).
  - Test form submissions (e.g., mailing list signup) for validation and confirmation messages.
- **Responsive and Cross-Browser Compatibility**:
  - Test the website on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari to ensure consistent rendering of library pages and search results.
  - Verify mobile responsiveness: test navigation, text readability, and button clickability on small screens (e.g., iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy S21).
- **Error Handling**:
  - Enter an invalid URL (e.g., https://boost.io/nonexistent) and verify that a 404 page is displayed with a user-friendly message.
  - Test form inputs with invalid data (e.g., incorrect email format) and check for appropriate error messages.
- **Performance**:
  - Measure page load time for the homepage and a documentation page, ensuring they load within 2 seconds under normal network conditions.
  - Test the site under low-bandwidth conditions to ensure usability.

**Expected Outcome**: All features (navigation, documentation, search, downloads, community interaction) work as specified, handle edge cases, and provide a consistent user experience across devices and browsers.

### 6.4 Regression Testing

**Purpose**: Ensure that new changes or updates (e.g., migration to boost.io) have not negatively impacted existing functionalities. Regression tests cover previously working features.

**Test Cases**:
- **Core Navigation**:
  - Re-test all navigation menu links to ensure they still direct to the correct pages after recent updates (e.g., content migration to boost.io).
  - Verify that dropdown menus (if present) function as they did before the update.
- **Library Documentation Integrity**:
  - Re-verify that documentation for critical libraries (e.g., Boost.Asio, Boost.Beast) remains unchanged and accessible, comparing with boost.org content.
  - Check that examples (e.g., HTTP SSL client example) are still available and functional.
- **Search Functionality**:
  - Re-test search with previously tested queries (e.g., “Boost.Asio”) to ensure results are consistent with earlier behavior.
  - Verify that search performance (load time, relevance) has not degraded.
- **Download Functionality**:
  - Re-test downloading the latest Boost release to confirm that links and file integrity remain unaffected.
  - Check that download instructions are still accurate and match previous versions.
- **Community Features**:
  - Re-verify that community links (e.g., to GitHub issues or mailing lists) are unchanged and functional.
  - Test any interactive features to ensure they work as before.
- **Cross-Browser and Device Compatibility**:
  - Re-test the website on all supported browsers and devices to ensure no new rendering issues have been introduced.
  - Verify that mobile navigation and content display remain consistent with prior tests.
- **Performance and Stability**:
  - Re-measure page load times for key pages (homepage, library documentation) to ensure no performance regression.
  - Test the site under high traffic (e.g., using load testing tools) to confirm stability.

**Expected Outcome**: All previously working functionalities (navigation, documentation, search, downloads, community features) remain unaffected by recent changes, and the site performs consistently.
