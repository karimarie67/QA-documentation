# QA Implementation Plan: Month 1 - Foundation & Planning

## 1. Align with the Dev Team

### Objectives
- Map out the current CI/CD process.
- Understand sprint cadence and deployment frequency.
- Identify pain points in the development and deployment process.

### Current CI/CD Process
- **Tooling**: Primarily using GitHub Actions.
- **Reference**: See [Workflow Mappings](#) for detailed process maps.
  
### Sprint Cadence & Deployment Frequency
- **Sprint Cadence**: No defined sprint cadence currently.
- **Deployments**:
  - Typically scheduled on Mondays, in the afternoon or after hours, to minimize weekend disruptions.
  - Deployment timing or day may adjust based on release needs or scheduling conflicts.
  - **Constraint**: Production lockdown for one month before a Boost release, requiring schedule adjustments.

### Pain Points
- **Lack of QA**: No dedicated QA process, leading to post-deployment issues.
- **Outdated Documentation**: Setup documentation is not current, causing onboarding and process inefficiencies.

## 2. Define QA Scope & Strategy

### Integration with CI/CD
- **Placement**: QA to include pre-merge checks and post-deploy validation.
- **Reference**: See [CI/CD Section](#) for detailed integration plans.

### Testing Types & Prioritization
- **Functional Testing**: Core focus to ensure features work as expected. See [Functional Test Cases](#).
- **Smoke Testing**: Validate critical functionality post-deploy.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes don’t break existing features.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**:
  - Currently not implemented.
  - Plan: Organize and establish a UAT process in collaboration with the team.

### Testing Approach
- **Shift-Left Testing**: Emphasize early and frequent testing to catch issues before they reach production.
  - Discussions started on testing individual tickets in local environments before merging to staging.
- **Environments**:
  - Current: Only two environments—Staging (AKA Develop) and Master.
  - **Action Item**: Draft a proposal for introducing a third environment to improve testing workflows.

### Automation Exploration
- **Tool**: Considering Playwright for test automation.
- **Status**: Research underway, as Playwright is new to the team.

## 3. Set QA Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Catch Critical Bugs**: Identify and resolve critical issues before they reach production.
- **Stable Deploys**: Ensure deployments are predictable and reliable.
- **Automated Checks**: Implement basic automated tests that run on every commit or pull request to provide fast feedback.
